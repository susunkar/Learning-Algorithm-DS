# Alphanumeric String Sort

Given a string containing alphanumeric ASCII characters only (`[A-Za-z0-9]`),
sort and print the string in the following manner:

1. all sorted lowercase letters are ahead of uppercase letters,
2. all sorted uppercase letters are ahead of digits, and
3. all sorted even digits are ahead of sorted odd digits.
